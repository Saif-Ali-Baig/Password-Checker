# Password Strength Checker Project

## Why I Started This

I wanted to learn Python and regex because I saw a lot of talk on X about password security. I thought building a password strength checker would be a cool way to practice coding and understand what makes passwords secure. Plus, it’s something practical I can use myself!

---

## Day 1: Initial Setup

### What I Accomplished

- Wrote a basic Python script to check password length and uppercase letters.
- Used regex for the first time to check for uppercase letters.
- Got user input and printed some feedback.

### Challenges and How I Resolved Them

**Challenge:** Didn’t know how to use regex. Kept getting errors with the pattern.  
**Solution:** Looked up regex basics on the web and found `re.search("[A-Z]", password)` works for uppercase checks. Trial and error helped.

**Challenge:** Code feels messy, and I’m not sure how to structure it better.  
**Solution:** Decided to keep going and clean it up later as I learn more.

### Next Steps

- Add checks for lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Make the feedback clearer and more professional.
- Figure out how to score the password better.
